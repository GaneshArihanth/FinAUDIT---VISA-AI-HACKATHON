> **"Your Intelligent, Privacy-First Financial Auditor"**

Welcome to **FinAUDIT**! This project is an enterprise-grade AI audit platform designed to validate financial datasets against rigorous global standards like **GDPR**, **PCI DSS**, and **Basel III**.

What makes it special? It does all this **without ever exposing your sensitive raw data**. By combining rigid mathematical rules with the reasoning power of Google's Gemini AI, FinAUDIT delivers professional "Independent Auditor's Reports" that are cryptographically signed for absolute trust.

## 🌟 Why FinAUDIT Exists

In the modern financial world, data is a liability. Storing credit card numbers (PCI DSS) or personal user data (GDPR) incorrectly can lead to massive fines.

**The Problem:**

- **Manual Audits are Slow**: Humans take weeks to check Excel sheets.
- **AI is Risky**: You can't just upload customer data to ChatGPT/Gemini because of privacy laws.
- **Rules are Rigid**: A simple "if/else" script can't tell you _why_ a transaction looks suspicious, only that it _is_.

**The FinAUDIT Solution:**
We built a bridge. We extract **Statistical Metadata** (min, max, null counts) from your data locally. We send _only_ that safe metadata to the AI. The AI acts as a consultant, explaining compliance gaps without ever seeing a single real name or credit card number.

## 🚀 Key Features & Capabilities

### 1. 🛡️ Absolute Privacy (Metadata-Only Analysis)

- **Guardian Layer**: Before data leaves your browser/server, we strip all PII (Personally Identifiable Information).
- **Statistical View**: The AI knows "User_Names column is 50% empty", but it doesn't know who the users are.

### 2. 🧠 Hybrid Intelligence Engine

- **Deterministic Rules**: 30+ hard-coded Python checks for binary pass/fail (e.g., "Is date format ISO8601?").
- **Probabilistic AI**: An LLM (Large Language Model) that reasons about the _results_ of those rules (e.g., "A low date validity score combined with high transaction volume suggests a legacy system migration issue").

### 3. 📊 Data Quality Scoring (DQS)

We grade your data on a strict 0-100 scale across 7 dimensions:

- **Completeness**: Are there meaningful gaps?
- **Validity**: Does the data look like what it claims to be?
- **Accuracy**: Are numerical values consistent?
- **Consistency**: Do related fields match?
- **Timeliness**: Is the data fresh?
- **Integrity**: Are relationships preserved?
- **Security**: Is sensitive data properly masked?

### 4. 📝 Cryptographic Provenance

- **Digital Fingerprinting**: We create a SHA-256 hash of your report.
- **Tamper Proof**: If anyone edits the PDF report later, the hash won't match, proving it's fake.

## 🏗️ System Architecture (How it Works)

Understanding the flow of data is key to trusting the system.

1.  **User Upload**: You drag & drop a CSV file into the React Frontend.
2.  **Ingestion Layer (`backend/services/ingestion.py`)**:
    - Pandas reads the file.
    - PII Guardrail scans for sensitive columns headers (e.g., "SSN", "CVV").
    - **Action**: Profiling generates a JSON summary (Metadata). Original file is discarded from memory.
3.  **Rules Engine (`backend/core/rules_engine.py`)**:
    - The Metadata is passed through 30+ Python functions.
    - Result: A big list of `PASS` or `FAIL` booleans.
4.  **Scoring Service (`backend/services/scoring.py`)**:
    - Aggregates passes/fails into weighted scores (0-100).
5.  **AI Analyst (`backend/ai/agent.py`)**:
    - LangGraph constructs a prompt: _"Here is the profile of a financial dataset. It failed the Negative Transaction Rule. Explain why this is bad under Basel III standards."_
    - Gemini 1.5 Flash returns a professional executive summary.
6.  **Report Generation**:
    - Frontend receives the Analysis JSON.
    - `jspdf` builds a pixel-perfect PDF report.

## 🎮 User Manual: How to Use

**1. The Dashboard**
Open `http://localhost:5173`. You will see a modern, glass-morphism interface. The center is your "Audit Hub".

**2. Analyzying Data**

- Click the **"Upload Dataset"** box.
- Select a CSV file. (Try one with financial columns like `Amount`, `Date`, `Account_ID`).
- **Tip**: If you don't have one, create a simple CSV in Excel with columns "ID", "Amount", "Date" and put some dummy data.

**3. Interpreting Results**
Once processed (approx 3 seconds), you will see:

- **Health Score**: A big number out of 100. Green is good (>80), Red is bad (<50).
- **Radar Chart**: Shows where you are strong/weak (e.g., High Security but Low Completeness).
- **Issues List**: Click on "Critical" to see exactly what failed.

**4. Consultant Mode (Chat)**

- Look at the panel on the right.
- The AI has already read your audit report.
- Ask it: _"Why is my Validity score so low?"_ or _"Write a memo to the CTO explaining these risks."_

**5. Exporting**

- Click **"Export Audit Report"** at the top right.
- A PDF will download. Scroll to the bottom to see the "Cryptographic Fingerprint".

## 👨‍💻 Developer Guide: Extending the System

So you want to add a custom rule? Here is how to add a check for **"Forbidden Countries"**.

**Step 1: Open `backend/core/rules_engine.py`**
Find the `RulesEngine` class. Add this method:

```python
def check_forbidden_countries(self, metadata):
    # Check if 'Country' column has 'North Korea' or 'Iran'
    # Remember: We scan distinct values from metadata, not raw rows!

    forbidden = ['North Korea', 'Iran', 'Syria']

    # We assume 'distinct_values' is part of our metadata profile for categorical columns
    if 'Country' in metadata['columns']:
        details = metadata['columns']['Country'].get('distinct_values', [])
        found_forbidden = [c for c in details if c in forbidden]

        if found_forbidden:
             return {
                 "passed": False,
                 "weight": 10,
                 "details": f"Found sanctioned countries: {found_forbidden}"
             }

    return {"passed": True, "weight": 10, "details": "No sanctioned jurisdictions found."}
```

**Step 2: Register the Rule**
In the same file, find the `run_compliance()` method. Add your new function to the list of checks.

**Step 3: Refresh**
Restart your backend (`Ctrl+C` then `uvicorn...`). Upload your file. The new rule will now impact the "Security" score!

## 📖 Glossary of Terms

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**: A strict EU law about user privacy. FinAUDIT helps check if you are collecting too much info.
- **PCI DSS**: Rules for handling Credit Cards. You should never store full card numbers.
- **Metadata**: "Data about data". If you have a spreadsheet, the _rows_ are data. The _fact_ that Column A is named "Age" and has an average of 34 is metadata.
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Names, SSNs, Emails. Stuff that identifies a human.
- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: The AI technology behind Gemini/GPT.
- **Provenance**: The history and origin of a document. We use crypto-hashing to prove the document hasn't changed.
- **FastAPI**: The super-fast Python framework we use for the backend.
- **Vite**: A modern tool for building React websites extremely quickly.

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: The AI chat isn't working/replying!**

- **A**: This almost always means your **Google API Key** is missing or invalid. Check your `.env` file in the `backend` folder. Did you restart the server after adding it?

**Q: I get "Upload Failed: 500 Internal Server Error".**

- **A**: The backend likely crashed while trying to read your CSV.
  1. Check your terminal output for the specific Python error.
  2. Ensure your CSV is comma-separated, not semicolon-separated.
  3. Ensure the file isn't empty.

**Q: Why are all my scores 100?**

- **A**: If your columns are named generically (e.g., `Col1`, `Col2`), our heuristic detector might not know what rules to apply. Renaming columns to `Email`, `Amount`, `Date` helps the system categorize them.

**Q: Can I run this with Docker?**

- **A**: Yes! The project includes a `Dockerfile` (or is Docker-ready). You can build a container to host it on AWS/GCP/Render easily.
